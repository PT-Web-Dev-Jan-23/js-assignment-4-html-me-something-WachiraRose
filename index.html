               Kenya is the historical home of the East African safari,
                a land of sweeping savannah grasslands inhabited by charismatic mega-fauna,
                 including Big Cats, the Big Five (elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard and rhino)
                  and just about everything in between. Elsewhere, landscapes here stir the soul with deserts in the north
                  , dense forests in the west, Rift Valley lakes in the center and tropical coast out east.
                   This result for those on safari is an experienced safari industry ready to show you a seemingly endless 
                   parade of wildlife against one of the most beautiful backdrops in Africa.

                  Lake Nakuru National Park is known for its spectacular flocks of pink flamingoes which throng on the lake itself to source minerals from the soda lake. The park is home to over 450 species of birds and includes other wildlife as well. Visitors can also see lions, cheetahs, waterbucks, hippos and white rhinos. The park also has the largest euphorbia candelabrum forest in the continent.

                  At 5,199 m, Mount Kenya is the second highest peak in Africa. It is an ancient extinct volcano, which during its period of activity (3.1-2.6 million years ago) is thought to have risen to 6,500 m. There are 12 remnant glaciers on the mountain, all receding rapidly, and four secondary peaks that sit at the head of the U-shaped glacial valleys. With its rugged glacier-clad summits and forested middle slopes, Mount Kenya is one of the most impressive landscapes in East Africa. The evolution and ecology of its afro-alpine flora provide an outstanding example of ecological and biological processes. Through the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and Ngare Ndare Forest Reserve, the property also incorporates lower lying scenic foothills and arid habitats of high biodiversity, situated in the ecological transition zone between the mountain ecosystem and the semi-arid savanna grasslands. The area also lies within the traditional migrating route of the African elephant population.
