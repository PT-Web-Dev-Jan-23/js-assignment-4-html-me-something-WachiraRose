                                <p>Mukimo is a tasty staple food cooked by mashing green peas, potatoes, maize, and pumpkin leaves or spinach leaves altogether. Sometimes beans can be used as a substitute for green peas.</p>

                                <h2>Ugali</h2>
                                <p>Ugali is a Kenyan staple. It's a dish made of maize flour, though it's sometimes made of millet or sorghum flour. It's made by adding the maize flour to boiling water until you get a dough-like consistency. It's a bodybuilding food and a good source of iron. I ate ugali many times as an accompaniment to beef stew and bean stew. I enjoyed it very much. Since then, I have learned to make it myself, and now I cook it often.</p>

                                <p>Githeri is a one-pot meal made up of corn and any kind of bean. It can be eaten plain or with onions, tomatoes, and seasonings of your choice. It is very easy to make and is one of Kenya's nourishing staples. This is comfort food, and I like to eat it when I am not feeling so well.</p>

                                <p>These are soft and layered flatbreads that are eaten in many East African homes. It is very light and is eaten with tea, beef stew, or beans. I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that Kenyan chapatis are one of the best chapatis you will ever eat.</p>
